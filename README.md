🌫️ Air Quality Analysis Dashboard using Python
📌 Overview
This project is a comprehensive Air Quality Data Analysis Dashboard built with Python. It explores real-world air pollution data, performs preprocessing, and visualizes insights using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to understand air quality trends, identify the most affected regions, and present pollution metrics in an easy-to-understand format.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used includes columns like:

City

Date

PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3

AQI (Air Quality Index)

📄 Note: The dataset was cleaned, formatted, and optimized before analysis.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies
Python 3.x

Pandas – for data wrangling

NumPy – for numerical computation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for visualizations

Jupyter Notebook – for an interactive dashboard experience

📊 Key Features
🧹 Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values (e.g., filled with mean)

Converted date fields and formatted columns

Removed duplicates and unnecessary data

⚡ Data Optimization:

Reduced memory usage with .astype() conversions

Efficient indexing and column filtering

📈 Data Visualization:

PM2.5 trends over time (line chart)

AQI category distribution (pie chart)

Average pollutant levels per city (bar chart)

Heatmap showing correlation between pollutants

Identified top 5 most polluted cities

📌 Results
The final dashboard offers:

Clean, insightful visualizations of air quality metrics

Clear understanding of pollution distribution across cities

Identification of key pollution contributors
